							Tips for Talent Applicants: 
							<br>Honesty, Integrity, and Preparedness
						</div>

						<p>As you prepare to join LEED Talents and connect with top international companies, it’s crucial to present yourself authentically and professionally. The way you represent your skills and experiences can significantly impact your success in securing remote opportunities. Here are some essential tips and warnings to help you navigate the application process and ensure you stand out as a trustworthy and competent candidate.</p>

						<p><span>Be Honest About Your Skills and Experiences</span> 
							<br>Transparency Is Key: Honesty in your application is crucial. Misrepresenting your skills or experience can lead to mismatches with potential roles, affecting your performance and reputation. Clearly state your true capabilities, educational background, and work history. This transparency helps us match you with opportunities that genuinely fit your qualifications and where you can truly excel. Providing false or inaccurate information can result in removal from the LEED Talents platform.</p>

						<p><span>Avoid Using Work Samples That Aren’t Yours</span> 
							<br>Integrity in Representation: Only include work samples that you have directly contributed to or created. Using work that isn’t yours not only undermines your integrity but also violates intellectual property rights and can lead to legal and professional consequences. If collaborating on a project, specify your role clearly to highlight your specific contributions.</p>

						<p><span>Do Not Exaggerate Your Skills</span> 
							<br>Accuracy Matters: While it may be tempting to embellish your skills to appear more competitive, overestimating your abilities can lead to positions where you may not perform effectively. This could harm your professional credibility and future job prospects. It’s better to be modest and accurate about your skills, as this builds trust and reliability with potential employers.</p>
